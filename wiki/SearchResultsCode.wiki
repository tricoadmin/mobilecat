A map of code for search-related files, broken down by javascript use

=== both ===
 * searchbox.html - if js, calls search, else call search_nojs
 * index.php
 * index.html
 * search_results.html - iterates through results to get cover & info.
 * cover_image.php

=== js-specific ===
 * index.js
 * search.php - sets search query and search.js, displays search_main
 * search_main.html - results page
 * search.js - js to go with results page
 * browse.php - called from search.js to populate actual results

=== nojs-specific ===
 * search_nojs_main.html - results page
 * search_nojs.php - pretty much does what browse.php does?
